## Word Count Using Apache Spark [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karasatishkumar/easylocate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karasatishkumar/easylocate)
We will be using spark 2.x to count words present in a text file. This is a simple project to demonstrate the distributed computing using Apache Spark. To ease the development and execution of the project, we will make use of docker to simulate the distributed computing ecosystem.

Before we start let's make sure we have the following prerequisites in place
* Java 8
* Maven 3.5
* Docker
* I use IntelliJ IDEA, you can use any other IDE

## Building from source
After completing the prerequisites, you can follow the instructions to build and run the project.
